Hi there! My name is Linghao Zhang (张凌浩). I'm an undergraduate (3rd year) studying at School of Computer Science, Wuhan University, supervised by [Peng Liang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peng-Liang-4) and [Chong Wang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chong-Wang-13).

My research interests focus on AI, LLM and their applications of Software Engineering, the intersection of Software Engineering and Machine Learning. Include code synthesis tasks, program language (code) models and bimodal (NL-PL) models. 

Software includes both deterministic, strictly defined <u>code syntax</u> and non-deterministic, natural language <u>text</u> (document, issue, commit, log, notation etc.). It's **Bimodality of Software** (from a [keynote](https://conf.researchr.org/info/saner-2024/keynote) presented by Prof. Devanbu). The work I'm doing now is about leveraging <u>deep learning</u> or <u>language models</u> (with the nature of non-deterministic) to handle the "naturalness" aspect of software engineering.
